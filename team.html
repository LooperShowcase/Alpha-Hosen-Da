      <h3>
        Nassr Football Club (Arabic: نادي النصر السعودي; Naṣr meaning Victory) is a Saudi Arabian football club based in Riyadh. Formed in 1955, the club plays its home games at the Mrsool Park. Their home colours are yellow and blue.

Al Nassr is one of the most successful clubs in Saudi Arabia, with 27 official trophies.[2] At domestic level, the club has won nine Pro League titles, six King's Cups, three Crown Prince's Cups, three Federation Cups, and two Saudi Super Cups. At international level, they have won two GCC Champions Leagues and earned a historic Asian double in 1998 by claiming both the Asian Cup Winners' Cup and the Asian Super Cup. The club gained international attention in early 2023 when Cristiano Ronaldo signed for the club on a two and a half year deal.

History
Beginnings and triumphs (1955–1989)
Al-Nassr was established in 1955 by the Al-Ja’ba brothers. Training took place in an old playground at Gashlat Al-Shortah west of Al-Fotah Garden where there was a small football field and a small room to store balls and shirts. In addition to the Al-Ja'ba brothers, Ali and Al-Owais. Prince Abdul Rahman bin Saud Al Saud became the head of Al-Nassr, he spent more than 39 years as the president for 3 stints till his death. His love of the team made him accept the challenge of being the president of a second division club and turning it to a champion and for that reason he is known as [Al-Nassr Godfather] they were promoted to the first division in 1963. During the 1970s and 1980s, the club won four Saudi Premier League titles, six King's Cups, three Crown Prince Cups and three Federation Cup. The team's success was built around the "Saudi Golden Trio" of Majed Abdullah, Fahd Al-Herafy and Mohaisn Al-Jam'aan.


Majed Ahmed Abdullah is Al-Nassr's all-time leader in goals scored and appearances.
90s era (1989–2002)
In the 1990s, Al-Nassr won two further Saudi Premier League titles, a King's Cup and a Federation Cup. They also had success in several international tournaments, winning two GCC Champions Leagues, one Asian Cup Winners' Cup and one Asian Super Cup. As a champion of Asian Super Cup, Al-Nassr FC represented the AFC region in the first FIFA Club World Cup in Brazil in 2000. In the competition Al-Nassr played against Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, Real Madrid and Raja Casablanca, and finished 3rd in the group. Al-Nassr won the competition's Fair Play award.

Setbacks (2003–2007)
After the Golden Trio's retirement, Al-Nassr went into some major setbacks. In 2006–07, the club only avoided relegation on the last day of the season, which prompted honorary members of the club to begin an effective long-term plan to revolutionize management and team members.

Recent resurgence (2008–present)
After a major overhaul of playing staff, Al-Nassr went on to win the Federation Cup 2008 against city rivals, Al-Hilal. The club finished third in 2009–10 securing Asian Champions League football for the following season. In 2011–12, Al-Nassr saw itself on the King Cup's final, only to finish as a runners-up, and in 2012–13, Al-Nassr continued its steady steps into returning to the Saudi giant it once was, where it reached the Crown Prince Cup final, only to lose to Al-Hilal on penalties.

In 2013–14, Al-Nassr finally achieved its long-term goal of returning to crowning stages, by earning an impressive double against city rivals Al Hilal in both league and Crown Prince cups. The team subsequently qualified for the 2015 AFC Champions League following the astonishing accomplishment.

In the 2014–15 season, Al-Nassr continued defending the title as holding champion, by winning the league, and reaching the King's Cup final, as well as qualifying for the Crown Prince's semi-final. The identity of a returning champion still persists within club halls.

In the 2018–19 season, Al-Nassr won the league, as well as making it to the King's Cup semi-finals, and the Asian Champions League quarter-finals.

In both 2020 and 2021, Al-Nassr saw themselves win the Saudi Super Cup in succession, beating Al-Taawoun FC 1–1 (5–4 pen.) in 2020, and beating their fierce city rivals, Al-Hilal, 3–0 in 2021.

On December 30, 2022, Al-Nassr signed Cristiano Ronaldo after the Portuguese player left Manchester United by mutual agreement. Ronaldo’s contract runs for two-and-a-half years until summer 2025, with a total salary of €200 million per year, thought to be the highest ever paid to a professional footballer.[3] He made an immediate impact on the global following of the club, with their Instagram account growing from 860,000 followers before his move to over 10 million followers less than a week later.[4]

Cristiano Ronaldo’s signing into Saudi Arabia’s Al-Nassr national team attracted mixed reactions, especially concerning the exceptions that the Persian Gulf nation was ready to make for the football star. The Portuguese player was in a long-term relationship with his Argentine-born girlfriend, Spanish model Georgina Rodriguez. The form of Islamic law practiced in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia forbids “cohabitation without a marriage contract”, which the Saudi government apparently agreed to overlook as it pertained to the footballer and his girlfriend. Experts claimed that the country was willing to overlook any legal complications incurred by Ronaldo’s transfer.[5]

Crest and colors

Former club crest
Al-Nassr is the Arabic word for "victory." Clubs with the same name are found in Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE, and Libya but the Saudi Arabian club was the first to take the name.

The club's logo represents the map of Arabia with yellow and blue colors. Yellow for the sand of the Arabian deserts, and blue for the water in the Arabian Sea, the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. Recently the old logo has been replaced by a "more modern version", but still is heavily influenced by the old club logo. The new logo only represents the football team while the old logo represents the club as a whole.
